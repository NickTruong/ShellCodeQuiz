## Welcome to Nick's Midterm Practice Room!

Here are some practice questions to complete!

**DISCLAIMER: This does not necessarily cover all the material to be covered on the midterm.**
**The prof has nothing to do with these questions.**
NONE of these questions are "official" in any sense of the word.
I simply made up some questions for material that I thought would be good to practice.
I personally do not know what the questions on the midterm look like.
These questions may be easier or harder than the midterm questions.

**Also, this could very well turn out to be harder than it should be, and if so, don't stress.**

It is totally up to you whether you want to do this, but I believe that if you can complete this work by yourself then you should have a very strong grasp of the material.

## Getting started

To start, just hit the `Fork` button at the top of the page or simply go to any file and start editing!

## How this works

All of your work will be done in the question#.py files. For some questions, you will only have to read the code and run it, guessing the output of a function.

DO NOT TOUCH `main.py` or any `*.txt` files!
In fact, don't touch the `main()` function in any of the files.
**Everything you need to do can/will be done in the `question#.py` files or in the terminal!**

**On the left sidebar, click on a `question#.py` file to read/work on it.**
Each question will at least have starting code to work with.
At the top of the file will be a comment describing the question.

In any question, feel free to create as many user-defined functions as you wish to help yourself. Just remember that in the end, the `main()` in your `question#.py` file is what runs!

## Running the code

To test/run a question, hit the `Run‚ñ∂Ô∏è` button at the top and follow the instructions given by the menu...

To provide user input, just type stuff and submit in the shell on the right as you would in any other python shell.

## Good luck on the midterm! üìù‚úîÔ∏è
